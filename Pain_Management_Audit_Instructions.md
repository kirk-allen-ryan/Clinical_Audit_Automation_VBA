## 📝 How to Audit

### 1. Patient Selection
* **Sampling:** Every 24-hour period, **two patients** are audited, chosen as randomly as possible from the designated census sheet.
* **Inclusion:** Sampling must include a variety of **surgical and non-surgical patients**.
* **Documentation:** The patient's **Name and MRN** are documented in the audit to facilitate post-audit chart access and follow-up.

### 2. Medications to be Audited
The audit focuses exclusively on **PRN Pain medication given and per policy blocks** during the 24-hour period.
* **PRN Narcotics:** Every PRN Narcotic (e.g., Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Dilaudid, Oxycontin, Morphine).
* **Continuous Infusions/Blocks:** Epidurals, Blocks, and On-Q pain balls.
* **Other PRN Pain Meds:** Tylenol, Valium, Methadone, Toradol, Gabapentin, and Ibuprofen, if given as PRN.

## ✅ Pain Assessment Requirements (Compliance Logic)

| Requirement | Complete Assessment Includes | Follow-up Assessment Includes | Compliance Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Assessment** | Score, Location, Laterality, Quality, Non-Pharmacological & Pharmacological Interventions, and Negative Impacts. | Score only. | Required when **score > 0** for pre-administration/scheduled checks. |
| **Score of Zero** | **No need** to complete the full assessment. | N/A | Always compliant. |
| **Missing Score** | **Not** counted as complete. | N/A | Failure condition. |

* **Audit Comments (Columns Q & R):**
    * **Column Q:** Reflects **who and what kind of assessment was missed** (used for reporting).
    * **Column R:** Reflects **possible reasons** for the missed audit (e.g., "nwat" for "not within required time," "NC" for "partial assessment"); these are used for quarterly report cards.

## ⏰ Audit Times (Policy Time Windows)

| Route/Type | Pre-Administration Assessment | Follow-up Assessment | Continuous Requirements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PO / Rectal** | Within $\frac{1}{2}$ hour before medication is given. | Anytime within 1 hour after medication is given. | N/A |
| **IV** | Within $\frac{1}{2}$ hour before medication is given. | Anytime within $\frac{1}{2}$ hour after medication is given. | N/A |
| **Epidural/Block/On-Q** | N/A | Within 1 hour after rate change/discontinue. | Every 2 hours for first 24 hours, then every 4 hours until discontinued. |
| **Shift Assessment** | N/A | N/A | **One pain assessment per shift** is required, even if no medication is given. |

### Narcotic vs. Non-Narcotic
* **Determination:** The medication being infused determines whether to mark "Yes" or "No" for narcotic classification.

### Pain Medication Effectiveness
* Calculated within audit sheet **Column N and O**. The calculation is based on the pain scores documented in **Columns K and M**.

## 🔢 Audit Calculations & Special Considerations

### Calculation Integrity
* Most calculations are completed within the spreadsheet. **Do not alter or type in a calculation cell** to avoid changing the final percentages.
* **Verification:** Ensure the following totals match:
    * **Columns F and H** have the same total.
    * **Columns K, M, and S** have the same total.

### Special Considerations
* **Downtime:** If results are unavailable, document **n/a** and note **“downtime”** under comments.
* **Pre-Surgical Meds:** Requires a **full assessment**. If the patient transfers departments before the follow-up window is complete, mark **N/A** for the follow-up assessment. Use the **In-house Transition Communication** form (in IVIEW) for exact transfer time.
* **Column H:** Used for calculating the medication type being assessed and **no patient days**.
